# iOSBridge

Curriculum for iOSBridge. Check out the [iOSBridge Wiki](https://github.com/mobilebridge/iosbridge/wiki).

New iOS workshops should be planned as a [new issue under the 'organizing' repo](https://github.com/mobilebridge/organizing/issues/new), not under this 'iosbridge' repo.  Issues under this 'iosbridge' repo should be for curriculum edits **\*only***.
